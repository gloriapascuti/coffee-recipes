DATASET SUMMARY FOR PROFESSOR
Student: Gloriasa
Topic: Heart Disease Prediction based on Caffeine Intake
Date: December 2, 2025

---

1. DATASET SIZE:
   - Total usable sample: 6,063 patients
   - All patients have complete data for: caffeine intake, blood pressure status, demographics, and comorbidities
   - Outcome distribution: 2,090 hypertension cases (33%) vs 4,231 without hypertension (67%)
   - This provides excellent statistical power for the analysis

2. BLOOD PRESSURE FORMAT:
   - Blood pressure is recorded as DISCRETE CATEGORIES (not continuous values)
   - Primary variable: BPQ020 - "Ever told you had high blood pressure" (Yes/No)
   - Additional categorical variables available:
     * Taking blood pressure medication (Yes/No)
     * Doctor recommended weight control due to BP (Yes/No)
     * Family history of hypertension (Yes/No)
   - Age at first hypertension diagnosis is also available (continuous)
   
   Note: Actual BP measurements (e.g., 120/80 mmHg) are NOT in this dataset. 
   We will predict hypertension STATUS (binary classification: Yes/No).

3. OTHER DIETARY/HEALTH FIELDS AVAILABLE:

   A) Macronutrients & Energy:
      - Total calories (kcal)
      - Protein (g)
      - Carbohydrates (g)
      - Sugars (g)
      - Dietary fiber (g)
      - Total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat (g)
      - Cholesterol (mg) 
   
   B) Micronutrients:
      - Vitamins: A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D, E, K, Niacin, Folate
      - Minerals: Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Iron, Zinc, Copper, Sodium, Potassium, Selenium
      - Antioxidants: Beta-carotene, Lycopene, Lutein+Zeaxanthin
   
   C) Other Dietary Components:
      - Alcohol (g)
      - Theobromine (mg) - from chocolate/cocoa
      - Moisture content
      - Various fatty acid profiles
   
   D) Comorbidities & Risk Factors:
      - Diabetes status (prediabetic, diabetic, non-diabetic)
      - Demographics: Age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income
      - (75+ total nutritional variables available for controlling confounders)

4. AGE RANGES:
   - Full dataset range: 0 to 80 years
   - Average age: 32 years
   - For cardiovascular analysis, we can filter to adults (18-80 years)
   - Pre-filtered samples available by age groups:
     * 18-25 years
     * 26-35 years
     * 36-45 years
     * 46-55 years
     * 56-65 years
   - Can stratify analysis by these age groups to examine age-dependent effects

RESEARCH APPROACH:
We will predict hypertension status (categorical outcome) from caffeine intake and control variables using classification models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest). The relationship between hypertension and cardiovascular disease is well-established in literature, allowing us to discuss heart disease risk implications.
